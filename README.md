# Cryptocurrencies
Unsupervised Machine Learning and Cryptocurrencies

### Background:
Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. We are doing analysis and we have to to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.The data we will be working with is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models.Since there is no known output for what we are looking for, we have decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, we have decided on a clustering algorithm. Then we will use data visualizations to share our findings with the board.

### Purpose:
A client asked for a list of tradable cryptocurrencies and wants to be able to pick them from a classification system.

Describe the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning, including real-world examples of each.
Preprocess data for unsupervised learning.
Cluster data using the K-means algorithm.
Determine the best number of centroids for K-means using the elbow curve.
Use PCA to limit features and speed up the model.

We understand what unsupervised learning is used for, how to process data, how to cluster, how to reduce your dimensions, and how to reduce the principal components using PCA. We are using all these skills by creating an analysis for our clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market.

We have split the analysis into four deliverables as follows:
- Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
- Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
- Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
- Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
